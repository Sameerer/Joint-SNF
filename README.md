## Installation

install.packages("r.jive")  
install.packages("SNFtool")

## Introduction  
Joint-SNF method uses SNF to integrate the joint structure extracted by JIVE method to obtain the fusion matrix.  
The fused network enhances strong similarities and weakens spurious associations between samples while reducing the noise. 
The realization of Joint-SNF method relies on the following two important algorithms.  
Extraction of joint structures by JIVE; Similarity Network Fusion
